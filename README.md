# WTWR (What To Wear)

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast based on your location. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

Clothing items are added to user profiles as they see fit, with options of whether it is a "hot", "warm" or "cold" peice of clothing & then the options are generated based on the current local temperature.

Everything has been seperated out into components & all modals pull from a main "ModalWithForm" component making things clean & easily reusable.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
